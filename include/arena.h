/*
 * A memory arena is a pre-allocated block of memory used for fast, efficient
 * allocation of many small objects or strings. Instead of calling malloc() 
 * repeatedly (which incurs overhead and fragmentation), the arena allocates 
 * memory linearly from its internal buffer. This is particularly useful 
 * in compilers or lexers where many short-lived objects (like tokens or 
 * identifiers) need to be allocated quickly. 
 *
 * Advantages:
 *   - Very fast allocations (simple pointer bumping).
 *   - Low overhead compared to repeated malloc/free.
 *   - Good cache locality for sequential allocations.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   - Individual objects cannot be freed; the entire arena is freed at once.
 *   - Memory usage may be higher if the arena is over-allocated.
